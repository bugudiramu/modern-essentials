# GEMINI.md - Modern Essentials Project Context

## Project Overview

**Modern Essentials** is a subscription-first D2C fresh essentials brand built with a focus on radical transparency and honest marketing. The project is a **Turborepo monorepo** using **PNPM**.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Clerk (Auth)
- **Backend:** NestJS, Prisma (ORM), BullMQ (Scheduling), PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Infrastructure:** Turborepo, PNPM, Docker, AWS S3, Sanity.io (CMS)

## Directory Structure & Local Context

Each major directory contains its own `GEMINI.md` with localized context.

- `apps/web`: [Web Storefront](./apps/web/GEMINI.md) - Customer-facing Next.js app.
- `apps/admin`: [Admin Dashboard](./apps/admin/GEMINI.md) - Internal operations and fulfillment.
- `apps/api`: [API Service](./apps/api/GEMINI.md) - Central NestJS backend.
- `packages/db`: [Database Layer](./packages/db/GEMINI.md) - Prisma schema and client.
- `packages/types`: [Shared Types](./packages/types/GEMINI.md) - Common TypeScript definitions.
- `packages/utils`: [Shared Utilities](./packages/utils/GEMINI.md) - Helper functions.
- `packages/email`: [Transactional Emails](./packages/email/GEMINI.md) - React-based templates.
- `packages/ui`: [Shared UI](./packages/ui/GEMINI.md) - Design system components.
- `packages/config`: [Shared Config](./packages/config/GEMINI.md) - Linter, TS, and Tailwind configs.

## Key Business Logic (The Core Mandates)

- **Subscription-First:** Primary purchase mode is recurring subscriptions.
- **FEFO Law:** "First Expired, First Out" logic is mandatory for perishables.
- **Radical Transparency:** Cost breakdowns and batch traceability are core.
- **Idempotency:** All webhooks (Razorpay, etc.) MUST be processed exactly once via the `webhook_events` log.
- **Immutable Ledger:** User rewards/balances are updated ONLY via appending to `ledger_entries`.
- **State Machine:** Subscription status transitions happen ONLY in `SubscriptionService`.

## Development Workflow

### Core Commands

- `pnpm dev`: Starts all applications in parallel.
- `pnpm build`: Builds all applications and packages.
- `pnpm test`: Runs the test suite across the monorepo.
- `pnpm db:migrate`: Applies Prisma migrations.
- `pnpm db:generate`: Generates the Prisma client.

### Conventions

- **TypeScript:** Strict mode everywhere. No `any`.
- **Git:** Conventional Commits are enforced.
- **NestJS:** module/controller/service/dto pattern for every module.
- **Prisma:** Always `ORDER BY expires_at ASC` when picking inventory.

### UI/UX & Reliability Mandates

- **Component Strictness:** 100% reliance on `shadcn/ui` components. Do not write custom CSS or custom components if a `shadcn` equivalent exists.
- **Error Handling:** Proper frontend/backend error handling is required. API calls must be wrapped in `try/catch` and failures must be gracefully parsed and displayed.
- **Loading Indicators:** All CTAs, forms, and data fetching must have explicit loading states (spinners, skeletons, disabled buttons) to prevent duplicate actions.
- **User Feedback:** Clear success and failure messages (via `sonner` or `use-toast` notifications) are mandatory for all interactions.

## Recent Architectural Changes

- **Product Variants:** Transitioned from simple products to a Variant-based model.
- **Dunning Workflow:** Automated retry logic for failed subscription payments.
- **Inventory Reconciliation:** System for syncing physical vs system stock levels.
- **Partner Links:** Integration for Quick Commerce links (Zepto, Blinkit).
